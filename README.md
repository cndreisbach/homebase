# Homebase

Homebase is a set of Ansible playbooks to set up my personal server(s) with
the self-hosted applications I use.

The inventory file is not kept in version control for security reasons. This
should make it easier to reuse these playbooks.

## Current applications

* [OwnCloud](https://owncloud.org/)
* [I, Librarian](https://i-librarian.net/)
* [Tiny Tiny RSS](https://tt-rss.org/)
* A static web site
